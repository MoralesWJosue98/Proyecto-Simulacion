    <ShortDescription>Interface with LS-DYNA (nonlinear analysis software)</ShortDescription>
    <Description>GiD LS-Dyna Interface, which is compatible with LS-DYNA v. 971, provides a completely graphical environment for several types of structural simulations. 
    However, the product is focused on crash test problems and necessary tools for seatbelt and airbag definitions have been implemented.
    Interface capabilities:
    * Handles discrete, beam, shell, solid, seatbelt and airbag elements.
    * Several material types vailable (elastic, rigid, isotropic, anisotropic, fabric, plastic, viscoelastic, springs, dampers, etc.).
    * Single and Master and Slave contacts definition.
    * Dynamic loads and constraints.
    * Several Joint types available (spherical, revolute, translational).
    * Fully GiD postprocessing functionality.

      * The interface do not require an extra password from wwww.compassis.com      
      * use modern GiD_Events
